# EvilAP-quickstart
little helper repo to get started with an Evil AP Setup  
This repo does not try to be complete, it is merely a good starting point in case you don't have all these commands in your muscle memory yet.  

## Prerequisites
* USB WiFi Dongle that support Master (AP) Mode
* hostapd in the path
* dnsmasq in the path
* no other resolver blocking port 53
* prepared to mess up your iptables rules in case you have anything set up
